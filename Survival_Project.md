This dataset will be comprised of two separate .csv files, both of which
will be combined then used to predict who survives on the titanic. But
first, letâ€™s load all packages that I will be using in this project.

# Import the Dataset

``` r
# First, we will load the train dataset.
train = read_csv("train.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   PassengerId = col_double(),
    ##   Survived = col_double(),
    ##   Pclass = col_double(),
    ##   Name = col_character(),
    ##   Sex = col_character(),
    ##   Age = col_double(),
    ##   SibSp = col_double(),
    ##   Parch = col_double(),
    ##   Ticket = col_character(),
    ##   Fare = col_double(),
    ##   Cabin = col_character(),
    ##   Embarked = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
# Second, the test dataset is loaded
test = read_csv("test.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   PassengerId = col_double(),
    ##   Pclass = col_double(),
    ##   Name = col_character(),
    ##   Sex = col_character(),
    ##   Age = col_double(),
    ##   SibSp = col_double(),
    ##   Parch = col_double(),
    ##   Ticket = col_character(),
    ##   Fare = col_double(),
    ##   Cabin = col_character(),
    ##   Embarked = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
# Then both the train and test datasets are combined into a single dataset.
full = bind_rows(train, test)
```
