This dataset will be comprised of two separate .csv files, both of which will be combined then used to predict who survives on the titanic.
But first, let's load all packages that I will be using in this project.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
library(mice)
library(randomForest)
```


# Import the Dataset

```{r, results='asis', include=TRUE}
# First, we will load the train dataset.
train = read_csv("train.csv")
# Second, the test dataset is loaded
test = read_csv("test.csv")
# Then both the train and test datasets are combined into a single dataset.
full = bind_rows(train, test)
```
